# ExcelPixelArt

# Background

Originally created to demonstrate the use of SAS data to generate an Excel pixel art, it is now put out there to share code with others. I built this years ago (using various code) and I now share what I had.

# Sample Usage

ExcelPixelArt.exe -i "Z:\scratch\Cigar.png" -o "z:\scratch\ExcelPixelArt.xlsx

##### Additional files included for testing
